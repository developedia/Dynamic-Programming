### Dynamic Programming
Whenever we have a problem that can be solved by breaking it into smaller sub-problems using a recursive relation between them then that problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming. Typically results of the sub-problems are used repetitively and thereby storing them in a memo brings the time complexity down drastically by avoiding re-computation over and over again.

Here are few problems and solutions using Dynamic Programming.
